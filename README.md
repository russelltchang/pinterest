# Pinterest

Pinterest Clone is my solution to a freeCodeCamp full stack project challenge, Build a Pinterest Clone. It allows users to upload images and favorite images uploaded by other users. The app's responsive design delivers a clear and professional layout when accessed from all type of devices.
