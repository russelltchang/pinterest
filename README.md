# Pinterest

Unauthorized users need to have a Github account mandatorily.

Pinterest Clone is my solution to a freeCodeCamp full stack project challenge, Build a Pinterest Clone. It allows users to upload images and favorite images uploaded by other users.

## Required user stories:
* As an unauthenticated user, I can login with GitHub.
* As an authenticated user, I can link to images.
* As an authenticated user, I can delete images that I've linked to. (In Progress)
* As an authenticated user, I can see a Pinterest-style wall of all the images I've linked to.
* As an unauthenticated user, I can browse other users' walls of images. (In Progress)

## Tech stack and key packages:
* This application uses a **MERN stack** of **React** + **Node** + **Express** + **MongoDB**. 
* Other packages include **Material UI**, **React-Router**, **Mongoose**, and **Passport**.
